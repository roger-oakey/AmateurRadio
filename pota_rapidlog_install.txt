Installing pota_rapidlog:

    To install and run pota_rapidlog requires that Git and Python3 be installed
    on the host system. See your host system below for specific instructions.

    Chromebook:

        Newer Chromebooks run a version of Linux that have both Git and Python3
        pre-installed. Add low cost and long battery life to that advantage and
        the result is that they make an excellent platform on which to run
        pota_rapidlog in the field.

        Follow these instructions to enable Linux on your Chromebook:

            https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439

        If you can't find the "Linux development environment" under
        Settings->Advanced->Developers, your Chromebook may be too old to run
        Linux.

        Once you have setup Linux and started it, you will be at a terminal
        window. Issue the following two commands to setup pota_rapidlog (note
        that character case is important!):

            cd ~
            git clone https://github.com/roger-oakey/K0RLO.git

        This will create a "K0RLO" directory in your home directory. To run
        pota_rapidlog, type the following commands (note that character case is
        important!):

            cd ~
            ./K0RLO/pota_rapidlog

        ...and pota_rapidlog will start running and your ADI (.adi) log files
        will found in your home directory.

        From time to time to assure that you have the latest and greatest
        version of pota_rapidlog, type the following two commands:

            cd ~/K0RLO
            git pull

    Other Linux versions:

        There are too many versions of Linux around to document the setup
        process for them all. Just make sure both Git and Python3 are installed
        on your version of Linux, and then follow the Chromebook instructions,
        above, for installing and running pota_rapidlog.

    Windows:

        To be supplied.
