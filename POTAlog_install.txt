Installing POTAlog:

    To install and run POTAlog requires that Git and Python3 be installed on the
    host system. Find your host system below for specific instructions.

    Windows:

        In a browser go to the following link and follow the instructions to
        install Git on Windows:

            https://git-scm.com/download/win

        Now go to the following link and follow the instructions to install
        Python3 on Windows (choose the latest "Stable Release", NOT the latest
        release!):

            https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

        Once Git and Python3 are installed, open a DOS window and install
        POTAlog:

            git clone https://github.com/roger-oakey/W3MIX.git

        To run POTAlog, open a DOS window and type:

            python3 W3MIX\POTAlog\POTAlog

    Chromebook:

        Follow these instructions to enable Linux on your Chromebook:

            https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439

        If you can't find the "Linux development environment" under:

            Settings->Advanced->Developers

        Your Chromebook is probably too old to support Linux, and POTAlog is not
        supported on such platforms.

        Otherwise start the Linux machine and then follow the "All Linux
        platforms" instructions, below.

    Apple:

        To be supplied.

    Linux distributions:

        There are too many different distributions of Linux around to document
        the setup process for them all. Just make sure both Git and Python3 are
        installed on your version of Linux, and then follow the "All Linux
        platforms" instructions, below, for running POTAlog.

    All Linux platforms:

        Once you have started your Linux environment, you will be at a terminal
        window. Issue the following two commands to setup POTAlog (note that
        character case is important!):

            cd ~
            git clone https://github.com/roger-oakey/W3MIX.git

        This will create a "W3MIX" directory in your home directory. To run
        POTAlog, type the following commands (note that character case is
        important!):

            cd ~
            ./W3MIX/POTAlog/POTAlog

        ...and POTAlog will start running and your ADIF (.adi) log files will be
        created in your home directory.

    Keeping POTAlog current, ALL PLATFORMS:

        From time to time to assure that you have the latest and greatest
        version of POTAlog, change directory into the W3MIX directory and issue
        the following command:

            git pull
